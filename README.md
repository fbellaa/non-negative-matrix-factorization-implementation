We implement two non-negative matrix factorization algorithms: L2-norm and L2,1-norm to examine their robustness when faced with noises dataset. In this experiment, we are using ORL dataset and extended YaleB dataset imbued with gaussian noise, salt & pepper noise, and block occlusion noise. Their performance are evaluated using Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE), Average Accuracy, and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) methods.
